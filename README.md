# 🌀 Haskell Practice

A collection of problems, concepts, and explorations I’ve practiced while learning **Haskell**.
This repository serves as a personal journey through functional programming, with examples ranging from beginner concepts to more advanced functional patterns.

## 📚 About This Repo

This repo contains:

* ✅ **Solved problems** – coding challenges implemented in Haskell.
* ✅ **Concept explorations** – experiments with Haskell’s core concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, type classes, monads, etc.
* ✅ **Notes & references** – explanations and takeaways for quick revision.

Whether you’re just starting out with Haskell or revisiting functional programming fundamentals, you might find these snippets useful.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)** or **GHCup** installed:

```bash
ghc --version
```

You can install via [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```

### Running Code

To compile and run a file:

```bash
ghc filename.hs -o output
./output
```

Or run directly with `runghc`:

```bash
runghc filename.hs
```

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Some of the Haskell concepts I’ve explored here include:

* Functions & Recursion
* Higher-Order Functions
* Pattern Matching & Guards
* List Comprehensions
* Type Classes & Instances
* Functors, Applicatives, and Monads
* IO in Haskell
* Problem-solving with a functional mindset

---

## 🌱 Goals

* Strengthen my **functional programming skills**
* Build a solid foundation in **Haskell**
* Document my **learning journey**
